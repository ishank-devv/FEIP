//Q10: Difference b/w Closure and Scope

// CLOSURE: whehever you create function within another function then
//the inner function is the closure, this closure is usually returned
// so that you can use the outer functions variable at later time
//

// SCOPE: whereas scope in JS defines what variable you have access to
// 1. Global Scope 2. Local Scope
//
// In case of Closure, there are
// 1.Global Scope 2.Outer Scope 3.Local Scope
